## Questions

**Q1.** Which day in April 2020 saw the most loans approved in West Virginia? 

You MUST do the following things when answering this question:
* Use the WV ppp loan data, which is in the data folder and is called lab_09.rds.
* Make a line chart with ggplot that:
  * has each date in April (i.e. 04-01-20, 04-02-20) labeled on the x axis (and only dates in April, no other month). To clarify, no data for any other month than April 2020 should appear on the chart. 
  * sets the height of the line for any given date -- its y axis value -- to the total number of loans on that date.
  * has an appropriate title, source, and x and y axis titles. 
  * adds a small circle (called a "point") on the line for dates that had loans. And to the left of each circle/point, shows the number of loans on that date.  I didn't show you how to do this in the prelab, so do some web sleuthing to figure it out! 

Basically, your chart should look like this image, which will appear when you run the codeblock below. 

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/chart_1.png"))
```

```{r}
# data
westva_ppp <- read_rds("data/lab_09.rds")

# table
westva_ppp_april20 <- westva_ppp %>%
  filter(str_detect(date_approved, "^2020-04")) %>% 
  group_by(date_approved) %>%
  summarise(
    total_loans=n()
  ) %>% 
  arrange(desc(total_loans))

# line chart
westva_ppp_april20 %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_line(aes(x=date_approved, y=total_loans)) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 day", date_labels = "%b-%d", limits = as.Date(c('2020-04-02', '2020-04-29'))) +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45,  hjust=1)
  ) +
  labs(
    title="Days in April 2020 with the Most PPP Loans",
    x = "Approved Date\n",
    y = "\nTotal Loans",
    caption = "source: SBA PPP loan database"
  ) +
  geom_point(aes(x=date_approved, y=total_loans)) +
  geom_text(aes(x=date_approved, y=total_loans, label=total_loans), hjust=1, vjust=0)

```

**A1.** April 28

**Q2.** What are the top 10 states that got the most PPP loans per 100,000 people? You MUST do the following things when answering this question:

* Make a codeblock below to write your code in.
* Use the csv of total PPP loans by state in the data folder (state_ppp_all) as your source for total PPP loans by state.  
* Use the tidycensus API to get a table of total population by state from the American Community Survey (ACS). To do this, you'll use use the alphanumeric variable for total population, which has the following "label" and "concept": "Estimate!!Total:" and "SEX BY AGE".  
* Use ggplot to make a horizontal bar chart that shows the top 10 states, with the length of the bar determined by the state's total PPP loans per 100,000 people. Give it an appropriate title, source, and x and y axis titles. 
* Make the bars on the chart blue! I didn't show you how to do this in the prelab, so do some web sleuthing to figure it out.

**A2.** 1. South Dakota 2. North Dakota 3. Nebraska 4. Georgia 5. Iowa 6. Illinois 7. Louisiana 8. Florida 9. Mississippi 10. Montana

**Q3.**  A scatter plot is a type of chart that helps us see relationships between two variables. One variable goes on the x axis, the other on the y axis.  For each row/observation in our data, a scatter plot puts a circle (or a "point") where the two variables intersect on a grid. 

Statisticians use scatter plots to show graphically whether one variable is correlated -- related, in a statistical sense -- with another variable.  A classic example is the [relationship between ice cream sales and temperature](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/scatter-xy-plots.html).  The scatter plot below (press play to load the image) shows that relationship, that an increase in temperature is associated with an increase in ice cream sales. When it's 12C, sales are 200 dollars, and when it's hotter, 25C, sales are 600 dollars.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/chart_2.png"))
```

We're going to use a scatter plot a little differently, to get a visual sense of two key variables: the amount of an approved PPP loan, and the amount that was later forgiven. We'll use it to answer some questions in a broad sense, about loan forgiveness.  This is just a jumping off point for further exploration. 

Our questions include: Were there a lot of people who had their loans fully forgiven?  Were there a lot of people who didn't have their loans forgiven? Were there a lot of people who had some of the loan forgiven? 

To answer those questions, make a codeblock and do the following:

1. Start with the a subset of the WV ppp loan data we loaded earlier.
2. Filter the data to examine only those loans less than $25,000.
3. There are a bunch of NAs in the forgiveness amount column, for the purposes of this assignment only, let's assume those are actually supposed to be 0. So make all the NAs 0. 
4. Make a scatter plot. I didn't show you how to do this, so look it up! 
5. In the answer space below, describe what you see and answer the questions posed above.  In a general sense, what do you think this means?  

```{r}
# wv
wv_less_25000 <- westva_ppp %>% 
  filter(
    amount < 25000
  )

wv_less_25000 <- wv_less_25000 %>% 
  mutate(forgiveness_amount = case_when(
      is.na(forgiveness_amount) ~ 0, 
      TRUE ~ forgiveness_amount
    )
  )

# scatter plot
wv_less_25000 %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x=amount, y=forgiveness_amount)) +
  labs(
    title="The Relationship between Loaned Amount and Forgiveness Amount",
    x = "Loaned Amount\n",
    y = "\nForgiveness Amount",
    caption = "source: SBA PPP loan database"
  ) 
  
```


**A3.** I see a positive relationship between the loaned amount and the forgiveness amount. As the loaned amount increases, the forgiveness amount also increases. This correlation makes sense to me. The federal government handed out PPP loans to retain jobs and boost the economy. It's contradictory if the federal government then turned around and asked for the money back. Thus, the forgiveness amount grows. Also, it makes sense that as the loaned amount grows, the forgiveness amount also grows because there would be no need to forgive a larger amount if it was never loaned in the first place. This correlation means that the loaned money is staying in the business's hands, rather than repaying the lender. The recipients aren't obligated to pay back the loan.
